        <h2>Namma metro</h2>
        <p>Namma Metro, also known as Bengaluru Metro[5] is a rapid transit system serving the city of Bengaluru, India. It is the fourth longest operational metro network in India after the Delhi Metro, Hyderabad Metro and Chennai Metro.[6] It also contains the first underground metro line in South India.[7] The metro network consists of two colour-coded lines, with a total length of 42.3 kilometres serving 41 stations. The system has a mix of underground, at-grade, and elevated stations using standard-gauge tracks. The metro has an average daily ridership of 400,000 passengers. By 2023, the system is expected to complete its phase 2 network and provide connectivity to the city's important tech hubs of Electronics City and Whitefield.

            The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (BMRCL), a purely state funded project by the Government of Karnataka, built and operates the Namma Metro.[8] Services operate daily between 05:00 and 23:00 running with a headway varying between 4â€“20 minutes.[9] The trains are composed of three to six cars. The power output is supplied by 750 volt direct current through third rail. Namma Metro was the second rail transport system in India to use 750 V DC third rail traction, the first being the Kolkata Metro</p>
